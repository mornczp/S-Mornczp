- The purpose of this plugin is to be able to export table data from a pane in reading mode into a CSV file.

Background: The fabulous Dataview plugin for Obsidian allows to dynamically create tables from an SQL-like query over your notes' metadata.
I wanted to be able to further use this created data in external applications, like MS Power BI, to create visualizations of that data.
But the plugin can export any table into a CSV file, even those you "hard-coded" in Markdown (if that makes sense for you) or those that were created by some other plugin.

Waypoint is an Obsidian plugin that automatically generates tables of contents/MOCs within your folder notes. Once a waypoint is generated, it'll automatically link to every note within the folder and its subfolders. The Waypoint plugin will detect when you create/rename/move/delete a note and automatically stay up-to-date. No more dealing with loads of tags or manually updating your own content maps!


- 可以在文件夹笔记中自动生成目录/MOC。一旦生成一个航路点，它将自动链接到文件夹及其子文件夹中的每个笔记。Waypoint插件将检测您何时创建/重命名/移动/删除笔记，并自动保持最新状态。不再处理大量标签或手动更新您自己的内容地图
